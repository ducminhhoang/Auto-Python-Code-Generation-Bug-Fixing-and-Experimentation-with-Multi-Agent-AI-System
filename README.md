# Auto-Python-Code-Generation-Bug-Fixing-and-Experimentation-with-Multi-Agent-AI-System
This project develops a Multi-Agent AI system that automatically generates Python code, runs experiments, and fixes bugs based on user prompts. Using Langchain, Langgraph, Gemini API, and DuckDuckGo Search, it streamlines development by automating coding tasks and real-time problem solving.
